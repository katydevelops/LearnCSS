Intro to Flexbox

parent element = "flex container"
children elements = "flex items"

main axis: primary axis along which flex items are laid out - not necessarily horizontal! It all depends on the flex-direction property.

main-start and main-end: flex items are placed within the container starting main-start and going to main-end

main-size: flex item's width or height - whichever is the main dimension is the item's main size

cross axis: axis perpendicular to the main axis is called the cross axis - it direction depends on the main axis direction

cross-start and cross-end: flex lines are filled with items and placed into the container starting on the cross-start side of the flex container and going toward the cross-end side

cross size: width or height of a flex item, whichever is in the cross dimension, is the item's cross size. The cross size property is whichever of "width" or "height" that is in the cross dimension
