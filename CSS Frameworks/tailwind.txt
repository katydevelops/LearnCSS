For Next.js projects, import Tailwind at the top of the  globals.css file: 

    @tailwind base
    @tailwind components
    @tailwind utilities

    @tailwind base - imports Tailwind's CSS reset and base styles - normalized styling across browsers and sets up a clean slate.

    @tailwind components - adds any pre-designed component styles provided by tailwind

    @tailwind utilities - imports the utility classes that Tailwind is known for (the bg-blue-500, p-4, etc)


Autoprefixer: PostCSS plugin that adds vendor prefixes to your CSS automatically;
    modern CSS features sometimes need browser-specific prefixes (-webkit-, -moz-, etc) to work properly in older or less common browsers. Autoprefixer ensures your CSS works across all major browsers by adding these prefixes where necessary; runs as a part of CSS build process to ensure that the styles generated by Tailwind (or other CSS) are compatible with all browsers
